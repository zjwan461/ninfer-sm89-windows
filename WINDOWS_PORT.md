# NInfer-sm89 — Native Windows (MSVC) Port

This branch makes [NInfer-4090](https://github.com/sergiuszm/ninfer-4090) build and
run on **native Windows** with MSVC + CUDA, without WSL or Docker. The upstream fork
targets `sm_89` + Linux; the Windows path was inherited but untested. This work makes
it actually compile, link, and run on Windows.

Verified on: **RTX 4090 (sm_89), Windows, CUDA 13.4, Visual Studio Build Tools 2026
(MSVC 14.51), CMake 4.4, Ninja**, against the `qwen3_8_27b` groupwise **v2** artifact.

Measured `ninfer-serve` on this machine (RTX 4090, INT8 KV, MTP3):
- Code generation, thinking off: **149 tok/s** decode at 98% MTP acceptance.
- With reasoning/thinking on: ~96 tok/s (acceptance drops on unpredictable text, as expected).
- Prefill: 280–740 tok/s depending on prompt.

These match the upstream fork's published RTX 4090 numbers (~148.6 tok/s code decode).

---

## What this port changes (Windows compatibility only)

The engine assumed a Linux/GCC toolchain. The changes are POSIX-to-Win32 shims, an MSVC
128-bit integer path, an MSVC-specific compiler flag, and one MSVC template-linkage fix.
Every change is guarded with `#ifdef _WIN32` so the Linux build is unaffected.

### 1. POSIX headers / functions → Win32 equivalents

| File | POSIX use | Windows replacement |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| `src/product/logging/startup_log.cpp` | `<sys/ioctl.h>`, `ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ)` for terminal width | `<windows.h>` + `GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo` |
| `src/product/logging/logging.cpp` | `<unistd.h>`, `isatty(STDERR_FILENO)` | `<io.h>` + `_isatty(_fileno(stderr))` |
| `src/product/logging/logging.cpp` | `localtime_r(&t, &tm)` | `localtime_s(&tm, &t)` (note: arg order is swapped on MSVC) |
| `apps/perplexity/main.cpp` | `gmtime_r(&t, &tm)` | `gmtime_s(&tm, &t)` |
| `src/runtime/engine/context_cost.cpp` | `<unistd.h>`, `unsigned __int128` | `<process.h>`/`<intrin.h>` + a small `U128` helper using `_umul128` |
| `src/artifact/reader.cpp` | `<fcntl.h>`, `<sys/mman.h>`, `<sys/stat.h>`, `<unistd.h>` (mmap) | Win32 file-mapping equivalents |
| `src/product/media_acquire/acquire.cpp` | `<sys/socket.h>`, `<arpa/inet.h>` | Winsock shims |
| `src/serve/request_log.cpp` | `<unistd.h>` | guarded include |

(Several of these were started in an earlier pass; this branch completes them.)

### 2. MSVC lacks `unsigned __int128` / `__uint128_t`

Two hot paths used native 128-bit integers, which MSVC does not provide:

- `src/runtime/contract/types.h` — attention-work saturating product. Uses `_umul128`
  to compute the 64×64→128 product as (hi, lo) halves.
- `src/runtime/engine/materialization_planner.h` — cross-product comparison
  (`delta*b` vs `delta*a`) to compare two fractions without dividing. Ported to compare
  the two products via their `_umul128` (hi, lo) halves. Added `#include <intrin.h>`.
- `src/runtime/engine/context_cost.cpp` — a full `U128` helper struct (multiply / shift /
  compare) backed by `_umul128`.

### 3. `/utf-8` compiler flag (spdlog / fmt)

bundled `fmt` (via spdlog) hard-fails on MSVC without `/utf-8`
(`static assertion failed: 'Unicode support requires compiling with /utf-8'`).
Added to `CMakeLists.txt` for both C/CXX and CUDA host compilation:

```cmake
if(MSVC)
  add_compile_options(
    $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:C,CXX>:/Zc:preprocessor>
    $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:C,CXX>:/utf-8>
    $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CUDA>:-Xcompiler=/Zc:preprocessor>
    $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CUDA>:-Xcompiler=/utf-8>)
```

This single flag unblocked the bulk of the object files (spdlog is pervasive).

### 4. MSVC template-member linkage (`= default` specializations)

`src/targets/qwen3_6/impl/runtime/program.h` defines explicit specializations of
`AdmissionCandidate<Variant>::operator=(&&)` and
`CapturePressureCandidate<Variant>::operator=(&&)` as `= default` out of line. MSVC does
**not** emit external symbols for defaulted special members declared this way in an
explicit specialization, so linking `ninfer.exe` failed with 4 unresolved externals
(LNK2019) for the 27b and 35b variants. Fixed by giving each move-assignment an explicit
body (`impl_ = std::move(other.impl_); return *this;`), which MSVC emits normally. GCC/Clang
accepted the `= default` form, so this is MSVC-specific and Linux is unaffected.

---

## Building on Windows

Requirements: RTX 4090 (sm_89), CUDA 12.8+ (13.4 validated), Visual Studio Build Tools
(MSVC), CMake 3.28+, Ninja, and vcpkg for `curl`/`ffmpeg`/`pkgconf`.

```bat
:: from a shell with MSVC env (vcvars64.bat) and CUDA on PATH
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path>/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ^
  -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows ^
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89 ^
  -DNINFER_TARGET_SM_COUNT=128
cmake --build build -j
```

`NINFER_TARGET_SM_COUNT` (default 128) sets the SM count the attention wave geometry
(`src/ops/softmax_attention/dense/causal_cache/`) is compiled for. Leave it at 128 for the RTX
4090 this project is tuned on; pass `80` for an RTX 4080 SUPER. It is not an architecture switch
— the build stays `sm_89` — and either value is safe on either card: a mismatch only costs wave
utilisation, never correctness. The value must be even and >= 66 (both head geometries derive
their split cap from it). The `CMakePresets.json` `release-4080s` preset selects 80 and builds
into `build-4080s`.

Products: `build/apps/ninfer.exe`, `build/apps/ninfer-serve.exe`,
`build/apps/ninfer-perplexity.exe`. At runtime, put the vcpkg `bin` and CUDA `bin` on PATH.

## Model artifact — v2 and v3 both work (on `main`)

This branch reads both **v2** (`NINFER\0\2`) and **v3** (`NINFER\0\3`) `.ninfer`
artifacts — the reader auto-detects the container version from the magic bytes, no build
flag needed. HuggingFace repos originally shipped v2 and have since migrated their `main`
to v3; either works here now. See
[docs/artifact-v3-port-notes.md](docs/artifact-v3-port-notes.md) for what v3 changed and
how this port reads it.

If you're on the `winport-v2` branch instead (plain Windows port, no v3 support), that
build only reads v2 and rejects v3 with `artifact magic is not NInfer v2` — download a v2
revision instead of `main` from the HuggingFace repo. For Qwen3.8-27B the pre-v3 commit is
`dc370fb`:

```
https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer/resolve/dc370fb/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer
```

## Running

```bat
ninfer-serve.exe qwen3_8_27b.ninfer ^
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 ^
  --max-context 168000 --kv-capacity 168000 ^
  --prefill-chunk 1024 --kv-dtype int8 ^
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft --preserve-thinking
```

For maximum decode speed on code, send requests with thinking disabled
(`"enable_thinking": false` / `"reasoning_effort": "none"` on the OpenAI route): MTP
acceptance rises to ~98% and decode reaches ~149 tok/s. For the full native 262K context
on 24 GB, use `--kv-dtype rk4v4-e8`.

### Faster still: `--spec dflash2` beats MTP, and its sweet spot isn't its max

Swept `--draft-tokens` on this RTX 4090 with a fixed code-generation prompt
(`enable_thinking:false`, greedy, same seed) to find the actual optimum instead of
guessing. `--spec mtp` accepts `--draft-tokens` in `[1,5]`; `--spec dflash2` (a real,
separate small autoregressive draft model — not a single-shot head like MTP, so it can
speculate deeper before its accuracy collapses) accepts `[1,15]`:

| Backend | draft-tokens | Decode | MTP/DFlash acceptance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| mtp | 3 (this doc's old default) | 137.8 tok/s | 96.2% |
| mtp | 5 (max) | 160.6 tok/s | 89.8% |
| dflash2 | 8 | 194.4 tok/s | 97.2% |
| **dflash2** | **12** | **210.9 tok/s** | 85.7% |
| dflash2 | 15 (max) | 201.5 tok/s | 76.8% |

**`--spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 12` is the fastest configuration found — 210.9 tok/s,
+53% over this doc's previous `mtp --draft-tokens 3` default.** Note the optimum is *not*
the maximum allowed value for either backend: acceptance keeps falling as draft-tokens
rises, and past a point the extra verification cost outweighs the extra accepted tokens
(dflash2 peaks at 12, then drops back down by 15). Requires the artifact to actually ship
DFlash2 weights (adds ~1.6 GiB to the load); the server auto-detects and requires them
when `--spec dflash2` is passed.

## Memory bandwidth ceiling on this RTX 4090 (2026-09-25)

`tools/hbm_bandwidth_probe.cu`, built with `nvcc -O3 -std=c++17 -arch=sm_89
tools/hbm_bandwidth_probe.cu -o build\hbm_bandwidth_probe.exe` and run with no arguments. The
monitor was on the RTX 4090 at 60 Hz and `ninfer-serve` was off. The buffers were 4 GiB each
(57x L2), with 768 resident blocks of 256 threads. Bus GB/s counts N bytes for a read or a
write and 2N for a copy. Two runs, best of 5 trials (median in parentheses):

| Method | Run 1 bus GB/s | Run 2 bus GB/s | Of the 4090's 1008 GB/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `kernel uint4 read` (pure read) | 839.1 (802.5) | 848.1 (844.2) | 83-84 % |
| `kernel uint4 copy` | 785.5 (774.4) | 791.0 (785.1) | 78 % |
| `kernel uint4x4 copy` | 785.8 (782.8) | 783.3 (783.0) | 78 % |
| `cudaMemcpyAsync` D2D | 820.6 (811.9) | 831.1 (825.6) | 81-82 % |
| `kernel uint4 write` | 748.9 (742.4) | 747.0 (743.1) | 74 % |
| `cudaMemsetAsync` (write) | 826.3 (722.3) | 826.0 (819.5) | 82 % |

These runs used the probe's former `--peak-gbps` default of 1792 (the RTX 5090's figure, 46-47 %
for the read here); the last column above is recomputed against the 4090's advertised
1008 GB/s, which is now the probe's default.

**Ceiling: pure read ~845 GB/s, copy ~785 GB/s.** Decode is a weight-read stream, so the GB/s
figures in this document are read against **~845 GB/s**, not the advertised 1008. On that
scale:
- Qwen3.8 tg128 (~800 GB/s) runs at ~95 % of the ceiling.
- The best K-split MMA instances in the DFlash2 verification (~680-690 GB/s) run at ~81 %.
- The Q4 gate+up at T = 13 (608 GB/s) runs at ~72 %.

## Qwen3.8 baseline on the Bonsai branch (2026-09-24)

Measured on `feat/bonsai-ternary` at `15df903` with `E:\LLM\qwen3_8_27b.ninfer` (15.92 GiB of
Q4/Q5 weights). The RTX 4090 also drives the desktop, set to 60 Hz; `ninfer-serve` was off.
The desktop compositor still preempts the GPU: a few kernels run 2-30x long, so profiled
averages sit slightly above the medians. These numbers are the baseline for prefill and
decode work on this model.

**Throughput** (`ninfer_bench --weights E:\LLM\qwen3_8_27b.ninfer -p 512,2048 -n 128 -r 3
--kv-dtype int8`, no speculation):

| Test | Result |
|---|---:|
| pp512 | 1821 tok/s |
| pp2048 | 2035 tok/s |
| tg128 | 47.0 tok/s (46.9 with the default bf16 KV) |

tg128 reads ~16 GiB of weights per token, about 800 GB/s. That is ~95 % of the measured
~845 GB/s read ceiling (see the section above); the advertised figure is 1008 GB/s.

**Prefill profile** (`nsys profile --trace=cuda,nvtx` of `ninfer_bench -p 2048 -r 3
--kv-dtype int8`, saved as `profiles/nsys/qwen38_pp2048`). pp2048 runs as two 1024-token
chunks; each chunk takes 512 ms wall and 510 ms of kernels. Share of GPU time:

| Kernel (route) | Shape (N x K) | Grid | Per call | Calls per chunk | Share |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `q4_linear_swiglu_mma_split_half_pair_kernel` (Q4 gate+up with SwiGLU) | 34816 x 5120 | 544 x 8 | 3.59 ms | 64 | 45.1 % |
| `q5_rowsplit_gemm_mma_kernel` (Q5 `linear_add`: mlp down, attention o_proj and GDN out_proj) | 5120 x 17408 / 6144 | 80 x 8 | 1.50 / 0.55 ms (medians) | 64 + 64 | 30.3 % |
| `rowsplit_grouped_mma_kernel` (mixed Q4/Q5 GDN in_proj) | 16384 x 5120 | 256 x 8 | 1.72 ms | 48 | 16.2 % |
| `rowsplit_grouped_mma_kernel` (mixed Q4/Q5 attention qkvg) | 14336 x 5120 | 224 x 8 | 1.32 ms | 16 | 4.1 % |
| GDN (`state_passing` 1.1 %, `prepare_wy_wu` 0.7 %, `output` 0.4 %, conv 0.4 %, gating GEMM 0.1 %, l2norm 0.1 %) | | | | | 2.2 % |
| Attention (`causal_attention_prompt_i8_kernel`) | | | 0.28 ms | 16 | 0.9 % |
| rmsnorm, sigmoid gate and other elementwise kernels | | | | | 0.6 % |
| Last-token head (`q8_ksplit_mma`, once per prefill) and bookkeeping | | | | | 0.4 % |

The GEMMs take 95.9 % of prefill time, all on bf16 `mma` with dequantization in shared
memory. Their rates are 50-60 T MAC/s: gate+up 182.5 G MAC per chunk in 3.59 ms, down 91.3 G
in 1.50 ms. For comparison, Bonsai's int8 t5 gate+up does 2048 tokens in 3.76 ms, about half
the time per token.

**Nsight Compute of one gate+up launch** (`ncu --set full` on the 21st
`q4_linear_swiglu_mma_split_half_pair_kernel` launch of `ninfer_bench -p 2048 -r 1 --warmup 0
--kv-dtype int8`, saved as `profiles/ncu/qwen38_q4_gateup_pp2048`). pp2048 launches this kernel
with T = 1024, grid 544 x 8, 128 threads, `GemmCfg<64, 128, 64, 64, 32, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1>`.

- Duration 3.31 ms at a locked 2.60 GHz SM clock.
- Memory: DRAM throughput 24 %; L2 throughput 38 % with an 88.6 % hit rate; 747 MB read from
  DRAM. The ~100 MB of Q4 weights are re-read once per 128-token tile, because they exceed
  the 72 MB L2.
- Compute: SM 32 %, tensor pipe (HMMA) active 32.5 % of cycles, LSU 30.9 %, ALU 20.1 %,
  issue slots 22.9 % busy, 0.92 IPC.
- Stalls: 8.67 warp cycles per issued instruction, made up of math-pipe throttle 4.43 (51 %),
  wait 1.86, selected 1.00, short scoreboard 0.56, not selected 0.24, barrier 0.23, branch
  0.12, MIO 0.11 and long scoreboard 0.03.
- Occupancy: 16.7 % theoretical and achieved, i.e. 8 warps per SM from 2 CTAs of 4 warps.
  **Shared memory limits it** (45.6 KB static plus 1 KB reserved per CTA, 2 CTAs per SM);
  the 157 registers per thread would allow 3 CTAs.
- No register spills and no local memory.
- ncu also estimates smaller gains: global stores use 16 of 32 bytes per sector (up to
  15 %), 9 % of global sectors and 8 % of shared wavefronts are excess (uncoalesced), and
  there are 8.0 M shared bank conflicts, mostly on stores.

The math-pipe throttle does not mean the kernel is compute-bound: the tensor pipe is busy
only a third of the time. With two warps per scheduler, back-to-back HMMAs from the same warp
wait on the pipe and no other warp can fill the gap. The levers, in order, are occupancy
(less shared memory per CTA, or a third CTA), then the coalescing of the epilogue stores.

**MTP decode, six prompts** (`ninfer.exe --prompt <p> --max-context 4096 --max-new 512
--greedy --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft`, thinking on by default, default bf16
KV):

| Prompt | tok/s | Acceptance | Tokens per round |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Lighthouse story | 81.0 | 37.3 % | 2.12 |
| Python merge | 119.1 | 70.8 % | 3.12 |
| Transformer explanation | 109.3 | 61.8 % | 2.85 |
| Historia de Chile (Spanish) | 95.5 | 49.9 % | 2.49 |
| Energy tips | 107.2 | 60.3 % | 2.81 |
| Train problem | 127.2 | 78.4 % | 3.35 |
| Mean | 106.6 | 59.8 % | 2.79 |

### DFlash2 round profile, draft 12 (2026-09-24)

This profile uses the "fast" configuration from the table above on a harder prompt, to see
where a round's time goes. Command: `nsys profile --trace=cuda,nvtx --cuda-graph-trace=node
build\apps\ninfer.exe E:\LLM\qwen3_8_27b.ninfer --messages
examples\cli\messages\scenario_code_python.json --max-context 8192 --max-new 512 --greedy
--no-thinking --spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 12 [--lm-head-draft]` (`profiles/nsys/
qwen38_dflash2_d12`, `_d12_fullhead`). Same build, desktop at 60 Hz, server off.

The prompt asks for a whole Python package with tests: 122 prompt tokens, 512 generated. It
is much less predictable than the quicksort request behind the 210.9 tok/s figure.

| Run | tok/s | Acceptance | Tokens per round | Rounds | ms per round (plain run / nsys) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| d12, `--lm-head-draft` | 77.7 / 78.7 (two runs) | 24.8 % | 3.96 | 129 | 51.2 / 51.4 |
| d12, full proposal head | 79.6 | 26.2 % | 4.12 | 124 | 51.6 / 52.1 |
| d6, `--lm-head-draft` (reference) | 101.9 | 35.6 % | 3.13 | 163 | 30.7 / - |

With d12 and the proposal head, accepted tokens by draft position are 100, 76, 59, 40, 31,
23, 15, 13, 10, 6, 6, 3 over 129 rounds. Positions 7 to 12 add 53 of the 382 accepted tokens
but almost double the verification width (T = 7 to T = 13). On this prompt d6 is 30 % faster.

**Where a d12 round goes** (`--lm-head-draft`; per round, 50.6 ms of kernels in 51.4 ms wall,
735 launches, all graphed). Phases are separated by `speculative_prepare_verify_inputs`
(drafter -> verify) and `speculative_select_accepted_hidden` (verify -> commit):

| Phase / kernel (route) | ms per round | % | Per call |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Drafter** (DFlash2 draft model, 5 layers at T = 13, proposal head, top-k, lattice selector) | **3.51** | **6.9** | |
| of which Q8 draft-layer MLP and projections (`q8_ksplit_mma`, grids 2176 / 320 / 384) | 2.47 | | |
| of which proposal head (`q4_ksplit_mma`, grid 8192) + top-k merge | 0.64 | | 511 us |
| of which conv prepare, context KV, sliding-window attention, norms | 0.40 | | |
| **Target verification, T = 13** | **46.78** | **92.4** | |
| mlp down 5120 x 17408, Q5 (`q5_rowsplit_gemm_simt_split2`) | 12.87 | 25.4 | 169 us x 64 |
| mlp gate+up 34816 x 5120, Q4 (`q4_ksplit_mma`) | 11.53 | 22.8 | 155 us x 64 |
| GDN in_proj 16384 x 5120, mixed Q4/Q5 (`rowsplit_grouped_mma`) | 11.17 | 22.1 | 201 us x 48 |
| attention o_proj and GDN out_proj 5120 x 6144, Q5 (`q5_rowsplit_gemm_simt_split2`) | 3.99 | 7.9 | 64 us x 64 |
| attention qkvg 14336 x 5120, mixed Q4/Q5 (`rowsplit_grouped_mma`) | 3.21 | 6.3 | 180 us x 16 |
| verify head 248320 x 5120, Q8 (`q8_ksplit_mma`) | 1.69 | 3.3 | 1.43 ms |
| GDN gating, conv, recurrence record | 1.42 | 2.8 | |
| attention (bf16 KV prompt kernel, rope, KV append, output gate) | 0.60 | 1.2 | 27 us x 16 |
| rmsnorm and elementwise | 0.24 | 0.5 | |
| sampling (argmax, top-k, finalize) | 0.04 | 0.1 | |
| **Commit tail** (`recurrent_fold` 0.33 ms, select, counters) | **0.34** | **0.7** | |

Without `--lm-head-draft`, the drafter takes 4.58 ms (`q8_grouped_ksplit_topk` over the full
vocabulary: 1.67 ms instead of 0.64). Verification is unchanged at 46.54 ms. The short
proposal head saves 1.07 ms per round (2 %). Here that is within the acceptance difference
between the two runs (3.96 against 4.12 tokens per round).

The drafter is cheap; the round is set by the T = 13 verification. That pass takes 46.8 ms,
2.2x a single-token decode (21.3 ms at tg128's 47 tok/s), while reading the same ~17 GB of
weights. That is ~365 GB/s, against ~800 GB/s at T = 1. At T = 13 the Q4/Q5 "few tokens"
routes are below the bandwidth roof. Estimates at ~4.5 bits per Q4 weight and ~5.5 per Q5:
- gate+up (`q4_ksplit_mma`) reads ~100 MB in 155 us, ~650 GB/s.
- The Q5 SIMT routes read down (~61 MB) and o_proj/out_proj (~22 MB) at ~340-360 GB/s.
- The grouped mixed Q4/Q5 mma for in_proj and qkvg reads at ~230-290 GB/s.

These three families are where a wider tensor-core small-T route would pay back. The GEMMs
make up 88 % of the round.

### Q5 tensor-core route for the DFlash2 verification band (`a29aed7`, 2026-09-24)

`a29aed7` routes the Q5 `linear_add` shapes to a new `q5_ksplit_mma_kernel`, with the
residual added in its epilogue:
- mlp down, 5120 x 17408, at T = 7..16;
- attention o_proj and GDN out_proj, 5120 x 6144, at T = 7..13.

T <= 6 keeps the SIMT split2 route. Validated on the RTX 4090, desktop at 60 Hz, server off.
Before and after were measured back to back with the same scripts.

- `ninfer_linear_add_q5_a16_test` passes (`OK Q5_A16 LinearAdd`). It includes the new route
  start at T = 7, the 13/14 and 16/17 route boundaries, and interior T = 11.
- `ninfer_q5_linear_add_bench --execution graph --repeat 100` (median us, and GB/s as the
  bench reports it):

  | T | 5120 x 17408 before | after | 5120 x 6144 before | after |
  |---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | 6 | 108.5 (542) | 110.6 (532) | 44.0 (473) | 45.1 (463) |
  | 7 | 119.8 (491) | 104.4 (564) | 51.2 (408) | 42.0 (497) |
  | 8 | 127.0 (464) | 104.4 (564) | 52.2 (400) | 42.0 (498) |
  | 13 | 182.3 (325) | 111.6 (530) | 79.9 (264) | 46.3 (455) |
  | 14 | 221.2 (268) | 114.7 (517) | 95.2 (222) | 96.3 (219) |
  | 16 | 246.8 (241) | 117.8 (504) | 93.2 (227) | 94.2 (225) |
  | 17 | 300.0 (198) | 312.3 (190) | 102.4 (207) | 102.5 (207) |

  Two route cliffs remain next to the band:
  - 5120 x 6144 at T = 14..16 (DFlash2 d13-d15): 96 us, against 46 us for the new route at
    T = 13.
  - 5120 x 17408 at T = 17 (`MmaResidualR64C16`, T = 17..32): 300 us, against 118 us at
    T = 16.
- DFlash2 on the profile prompt (`scenario_code_python`, `--no-thinking --greedy
  --lm-head-draft`), with MTP as the regression check:

  | Run | tok/s before -> after | Acceptance | Tokens per round | ms per round | Text |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | DFlash2 d6 | 102.0 -> 129.6 | 35.6 -> 46.5 % | 3.13 -> 3.79 | 30.7 -> 28.9 (-6 %) | differs from char 21 |
  | DFlash2 d12 | 79.1 -> 99.5 | 24.8 -> 26.8 % | 3.96 -> 4.19 | 50.4 -> 41.8 (-17 %) | differs from char 220 |
  | Qwen3.8 MTP 3 | 124.5 -> 126.6 | 74.6 % both | 3.23 both | 25.9 -> 25.3 | identical (md5) |
  | Bonsai MTP 2 (lighthouse prompt) | 149.8 -> 153.9 | 42.4 % both | 1.85 both | 12.2 -> 11.8 | identical (md5) |

  The DFlash2 texts change because the verification sums in a different order, and this
  prompt has a near-tie at the fifth token ("complete, self-contained" against "complete,
  runnable"). Every speculative run leaves plain greedy decoding (no speculation, T = 1)
  there, including MTP 3, whose route did not change. After the change, d6 takes the
  "runnable" branch that d12 and MTP 3 already took. d12 diverges at char 220
  ("asyncio semaphore" against "asyncio lock"). Both texts are valid and of the same length
  (1988 against 1953-1973 chars). Most of d6's tok/s gain therefore comes from a more
  predictable text. The per-round time is the comparable figure: -6 % at d6 (T = 7) and
  -17 % at d12 (T = 13).
- d12 round (`profiles/nsys/qwen38_dflash2_d12_q5band`, same analysis as above), per round:
  - wall 51.4 -> 43.9 ms; verification 46.8 -> 39.5 ms; drafter unchanged (3.5 ms).
  - mlp down 12.87 -> 7.78 ms (169 -> 102 us per call; ~59 MB at ~350 -> ~580 GB/s).
  - o_proj and out_proj 3.99 -> 2.41 ms (64 -> 38 us; ~21 MB at ~330 -> ~560 GB/s).

  Byte counts are the bench's for the same shapes. The verification's largest costs are now
  the two other small-T families: Q4 gate+up (11.5 ms, 155 us per call) and the grouped
  mixed Q4/Q5 in_proj and qkvg (10.9 + 3.2 ms, ~180-200 us per call, ~230-290 GB/s).

### K-split GDN in_proj and the k = 6144 route through T = 16 (`58b5683`, `fa5dad0`, 2026-09-25)

The two commits extend the small-T K-split routes to the rest of the DFlash2 band:
- `58b5683`: the mixed Q4/Q5 GDN input projection runs its two sides as separate K-split
  MMAs up to T = 16. The Q4 side is 4096 rows (`q4_ksplit_mma`, grid 256); the Q5 side is
  12288 rows (`q5_ksplit_mma`, grid 768). They replace `rowsplit_grouped_mma`.
- `fa5dad0`: the 5120 x 6144 Q5 `linear_add` takes the K-split route through T = 16, closing
  the T = 14..16 cliff.

Validated on the RTX 4090 at HEAD `fa5dad0` against the `a29aed7` build, with the same
scripts, desktop at 60 Hz and server off.

- `ninfer_linear_add_q5_a16_test`, `ninfer_gdn_input_proj_test`,
  `ninfer_gdn_input_proj_conv_snapshot_test` and `ninfer_gdn_input_proj_conv_record_test` all
  pass (the snapshot test compares against its sampled FP64 reference with 0 failures).
- Microbenches, graph execution, 100 repeats, median us (bench-reported GB/s):

  | T | Q5 `linear_add` 5120 x 6144, a29aed7 -> fa5dad0 | GDN in_proj Q4/Q5 16384 x 5120 (cold L2), a29aed7 -> fa5dad0 |
  |---:|---|---|
  | 7 | 43.0 -> 44.0 | 97.3 -> 98.3 (542 -> 536) |
  | 12 | 45.1 -> 47.1 | 157.7 -> 98.3 (336 -> 539) |
  | 13 | 46.1 -> 48.1 | 225.3 -> 97.3 (235 -> 545) |
  | 14 | 95.3 -> 48.1 (222 -> 439) | - |
  | 15 | 95.2 -> 49.2 | - |
  | 16 | 95.2 -> 48.1 (222 -> 440) | 226.3 -> 104.4 (235 -> 509) |
  | 17 | 101.4 -> 101.4 | 226.3 -> 227.3 |

  5120 x 17408 is unchanged (T = 7 / 13 / 16 / 17: 103 / 113 / 117 / 299 us). T <= 6 is
  unchanged in both benches.
- DFlash2 on the profile prompt (`scenario_code_python`, `--no-thinking --greedy
  --lm-head-draft`), per-round time against `a29aed7`:

  | Draft | ms per round a29aed7 -> fa5dad0 | tok/s | Acceptance | Tokens per round | Text vs a29aed7 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | d6 (T = 7) | 28.9 -> 29.6 (noise; T = 7 was already on the new routes) | 129.6 -> 129.3 | 46.5 % | 3.79 | identical |
  | d12 (T = 13) | 41.8 -> 36.4 (-13 %) | 99.5 -> 116.5 | 26.8 -> 27.1 % | 4.19 -> 4.22 | now identical to d6's text |
  | d15 (T = 16) | 46.8 -> 37.6 (-20 %) | 86.0 -> 108.7 (+26 %) | 20.7 -> 20.9 % | 4.06 -> 4.09 | identical |
  | Qwen3.8 MTP 3 | 25.3 -> 25.3 | 126.6 -> 128.5 | 74.6 % | 3.23 | identical (md5) |
  | Bonsai MTP 2 | 11.8 -> 11.8 | 153.9 -> 154.6 | 42.4 % | 1.85 | identical (md5) |

  d15's text is unchanged, so its +26 % is a like-for-like speedup. d12 now produces exactly
  d6's text. On this prompt d6 is still the fastest configuration (129 tok/s), but d12 is
  within 10 % of it (116.5); it was 23 % behind after `a29aed7` and 22 % behind before it.
- d12 round (`profiles/nsys/qwen38_dflash2_d12_ksplit16`), per round:
  - wall 43.9 -> 37.7 ms; verification 39.5 -> 33.3 ms; drafter 3.55 ms.
  - 782 launches (+48: the two in_proj sides).
  - GDN in_proj 10.85 -> 4.51 ms: 201 -> ~94 us per layer (Q4 side ~20 us + Q5 side ~61 us,
    plus launch gaps), ~53 MB at ~565 GB/s.
  - mlp down 7.86 ms (102 us) and o_proj/out_proj 2.46 ms (39 us), unchanged.

  What remains of the T = 13 verification:
  - Q4 gate+up: 11.3 ms, 155 us per call, ~650 GB/s.
  - attention qkvg: 3.2 ms, still `rowsplit_grouped_mma` at 179 us per call, ~245 GB/s. It
    is the last grouped route in the band; the GDN treatment would save ~1.5 ms per round.
  - head: 1.7 ms.

Across the three commits, the d12 round on this prompt went from 51.4 to 37.7 ms (-27 %),
and d12 decode from 78.7 to 116.5 tok/s.

### K-split qkvg (`cccaace`, 2026-09-25)

`cccaace` moves the mixed Q4/Q5 attention input projection (qkvg, 14336 x 5120) to separate
K-split MMA sides up to T = 16, as `58b5683` did for the GDN in_proj. The Q4 side is 7168
rows (`q4_ksplit_mma`, grid 448); the Q5 side is 7168 rows (`q5_ksplit_mma`, grid 448). They
replace `rowsplit_grouped_mma`, the last grouped route in the DFlash2 band. Validated against
the `fa5dad0` build with the same method.

- `ninfer_attn_input_proj_test` passes (`OK attn_input_proj`, 25 s). It covers T = 1..128
  and graph replay at 12, 13, 16 and 17.
- `ninfer_attn_input_proj_bench --format q4q5 --cache cold --execution graph --repeat 100`,
  median us (bench-reported GB/s), `fa5dad0` -> `cccaace`:

  | T | 1 | 6 | 7 | 12 | 13 | 16 | 17 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | qkvg | 72.7 -> 72.7 | 114.7 -> 114.7 | 85.0 -> 86.0 | 123.9 -> 97.3 (356 -> 453) | 195.6 -> 90.1 (225 -> 489) | 195.6 -> 103.4 (226 -> 427) | 196.6 -> 197.6 |

  A pre-existing cliff shows up next to the band: T = 6 (114.7 us) is slower than T = 7
  (85.0 us). It matters for MTP 5 (T = 6) and for DFlash2 d5.
- DFlash2 on the profile prompt, per-round time against `fa5dad0`:

  | Draft | ms per round | tok/s | Acceptance | Text |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | d6 | 29.6 -> 29.6 | 129.3 -> 126.8 | 46.5 % | identical |
  | d12 | 36.4 -> 35.5 | 116.5 -> 119.7 | 27.1 % | identical |
  | d15 | 37.6 -> 37.1 | 108.7 -> 111.0 | 20.9 -> 21.1 % | changes (a tie; now `a29aed7`'s d12 text) |
  | Qwen3.8 MTP 3 | 25.3 -> 25.9 | 128.5 -> 124.6 | 74.6 % | identical (md5) |
  | Bonsai MTP 2 | 11.8 -> 12.2 | 154.6 -> 149.6 | 42.4 % | identical (md5) |

  The MTP rows and d6 use none of the changed routes. Their ±0.5 ms is the run-to-run noise
  of these 3-5 s decodes at 60 Hz.
- d12 round (`profiles/nsys/qwen38_dflash2_d12_qkvg16`), per round:
  - wall 37.7 -> 36.0 ms; verification 33.3 -> 31.4 ms.
  - 798 launches (+16: the two qkvg sides).
  - qkvg 3.23 -> 1.34 ms: 179 -> ~76 us per layer (Q4 side 33.8 + Q5 side 41.7 us),
    ~577 GB/s.

  Across the four commits the d12 round went from 51.4 to 36.0 ms (-30 %).

K-split MMA instances in the d12 round. Medians over 121 rounds. Bytes are the stored
weights: Q4_G64 34 bytes and Q5_G64 42 bytes per 64 weights. Activations and outputs are
under 0.2 MB and are ignored.

| Instance | Kernel, grid | Rows x K | MB | Calls per round | Median us | GB/s |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mlp gate+up (verify) | `q4_ksplit_mma`, 2176 | 34816 x 5120 | 94.7 | 64 | 155.7 | 608 |
| GDN in_proj Q4 side (verify) | `q4_ksplit_mma`, 256 | 4096 x 5120 | 11.1 | 48 | 20.9 | 532 |
| attn qkvg Q4 side (verify) | `q4_ksplit_mma`, 448 | 7168 x 5120 | 19.5 | 16 | 33.8 | 576 |
| DFlash2 proposal head (drafter) | `q4_ksplit_mma`, 8192 | 131072 x 5120 | 356.5 | 1 | 518.8 | 687 |
| GDN in_proj Q5 side (verify) | `q5_ksplit_mma`, 768 | 12288 x 5120 | 41.3 | 48 | 60.9 | 678 |
| attn qkvg Q5 side (verify) | `q5_ksplit_mma`, 448 | 7168 x 5120 | 24.1 | 16 | 41.7 | 577 |
| mlp down (verify) | `q5_ksplit_mma`, 320 | 5120 x 17408 | 58.5 | 64 | 102.8 | 569 |
| o_proj/out_proj (verify) | `q5_ksplit_mma`, 320 | 5120 x 6144 | 20.6 | 64 | 38.2 | 540 |

With the exact byte counts, gate+up reaches 608 GB/s, not the ~650 estimated above at
4.5 bits per weight. The largest instances reach ~680-690 GB/s (proposal head, GDN Q5 side),
so gate+up (11.4 ms per round, a third of the verification) is ~12 % below what the same
kernel family already reaches. The small sides (GDN Q4 at 21 us, o_proj at 38 us) pay a
fixed launch-and-tail cost for their size.

### Phase 3: `q4_ksplit_mma` launch bound (`1acd5db`, 2026-09-25)

`1acd5db` sizes the launch bound of `q4_ksplit_mma` from its shared-memory tile, with no
register spills. Validated at HEAD `e710b6b` against the `cccaace` build, with the same
method, desktop at 60 Hz and server off.

- Six tests pass: `ninfer_linear_swiglu_q4_a16_test`, `ninfer_linear_q4_a16_test`,
  `ninfer_attn_input_proj_test`, `ninfer_gdn_input_proj_test`,
  `ninfer_gdn_input_proj_conv_snapshot_test` (0 failures against the sampled FP64 reference)
  and `ninfer_gdn_input_proj_conv_record_test`.
- d12 round (`profiles/nsys/qwen38_dflash2_d12_phase3`), `q4_ksplit_mma` instances, median
  over 121 rounds, `cccaace` -> `1acd5db`. GB/s is against the ~845 GB/s read ceiling:

  | Instance | Median us | GB/s | Of the ceiling |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | mlp gate+up, 34816 x 5120 (x64 per round) | 155.7 -> 118.2 | 608 -> 801 | 72 -> 95 % |
  | GDN in_proj Q4 side, 4096 x 5120 (x48) | 20.9 -> 19.0 | 532 -> 585 | 63 -> 69 % |
  | attn qkvg Q4 side, 7168 x 5120 (x16) | 33.8 -> 31.2 | 576 -> 624 | 68 -> 74 % |
  | DFlash2 proposal head, 131072 x 5120 (drafter, x1) | 518.8 -> 421.8 | 687 -> 845 | 81 -> 100 % |

  The Q5 instances are unchanged: down 102.0 us, o_proj/out_proj 38.4, GDN Q5 side 61.0,
  qkvg Q5 side 41.3.
- Per round: wall 36.0 -> 33.5 ms; verification 31.4 -> 29.0 ms; gate+up 11.4 -> 9.0 ms;
  drafter 3.53 -> 3.48 ms.
- Plain runs (`scenario_code_python`, `--no-thinking --greedy --lm-head-draft`), ms per round
  `cccaace` -> `1acd5db`, and text md5 against `cccaace`:

  | Run | ms per round | tok/s | Text |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | DFlash2 d6 | 29.6 -> 30.4 | 126.8 -> 125.4 | identical |
  | DFlash2 d12 | 35.5 -> 33.1 (-7 %) | 119.7 -> 128.9 | identical |
  | DFlash2 d15 | 37.1 -> 33.9 (-9 %) | 111.0 -> 122.2 | identical |
  | Qwen3.8 MTP 3 | 25.9 -> 26.6 | 124.6 -> 122.2 | identical (md5) |
  | Bonsai MTP 2 | 12.2 -> 12.2 | 149.6 -> 148.8 | identical (md5) |

  d6 and MTP 3 move by about 0.8 ms, within the run-to-run spread of these 3-5 s decodes at
  60 Hz (±0.5-0.9 ms in the earlier rounds). On this prompt d12 (128.9 tok/s) is now the
  fastest DFlash2 window, ahead of d6 (125.4).

Across the five commits the d12 round went from 51.4 to 33.5 ms (-35 %), and d12 decode from
78.7 to 128.9 tok/s.

## Quality: tools/eval, Ternary Bonsai 2 27B against Qwen3.8-27B (2026-09-25)

`tools/eval` (45 deterministic tasks, see [tools/eval/README.md](tools/eval/README.md)), run
at HEAD `3c2e263` on the RTX 4090. Commands:

```powershell
python -m tools.eval run --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1 --label bonsai --out E:\eval\results_bonsai.json --thinking off
python -m tools.eval run --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1 --label qwen38 --out E:\eval\results_qwen38.json --thinking off
python -m tools.eval compare E:\eval\results_bonsai.json E:\eval\results_qwen38.json --markdown E:\eval\compare.md
```

Settings: greedy (temperature 0, seed 1234), one sample per task. Each model ran on
`ninfer-serve` with the flags of its local launcher, bound to 127.0.0.1:
- **bonsai:** `bonsai2_27b_vl.ninfer` with `start-bonsai-server - ninfer.bat`: rk4v4-e8 KV,
  262144 context, 3 lanes, MTP 2 with `--lm-head-draft`, Vision.
- **qwen38:** `qwen3_8_27b.ninfer` with `start-ninfer-server.bat`: rk4v4-e8 KV, 100000
  context, 3 lanes, DFlash2 d6 with `--lm-head-draft`, `--no-cuda-graph`.

The tok/s and latency columns therefore reflect each launcher's speculation and graph
settings, not the model alone.

| Run | Passed | Pass rate | Mean latency s | Mean output tokens | Mean tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| bonsai | 43/45 | 95.6 % | 1.2 | 124 | 200.6 |
| qwen38 | 44/45 | 97.8 % | 1.9 | 147 | 147.1 |

| Category | bonsai | qwen38 |
|---|---|---|
| code_python | 7/7 | 7/7 |
| instruction_following | 6/7 | 7/7 |
| json_output | 4/5 | 4/5 |
| long_context (4K/16K/32K needle) | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| reasoning_math | 8/8 | 8/8 |
| spanish | 6/6 | 6/6 |
| tool_calling | 9/9 | 9/9 |

Failures. All three are the model's; the tasks and checkers behaved as intended:
- bonsai `if.answer_in_spanish`: answered in English although the system prompt says "Always
  answer in Spanish".
- bonsai `json.order_total`: `"total": 12.00`; the order is 3 x 1.50 + 2 x 4.25 = 13.
- qwen38 `json.order_total`: `"total": 16.25`. With thinking off, both models write the total
  without working it out.

The only task that separates the two models is `if.answer_in_spanish`. With 5 to 9 tasks per
category and one greedy sample, a one-task difference is noise (tools/eval README, Caveats):
on this suite the ternary Bonsai matches Qwen3.8 within noise.

## Qwen3.8 server with CUDA graphs: VRAM budget (2026-09-25)

Windows' baseline, from `nvidia-smi` with every NInfer process stopped: 1464 MiB of 24564

tokens of rk4v4-e8, 17408 bytes per token), `gdn_state_bytes=923664384` (3 device state
slots, 308 MB each), `replay_records_bytes=37545984`, `workspace_bytes=219974656` and
`persistent_arena_bytes=3056051968`.

The CUDA graphs cost 480 MiB with one lane and 1152 MiB with three. Ways to fit graphs, each
from the measurements above:
- one lane (`--max-concurrency 1 --device-state-slots 1`) at the full 100000 KV;
- three lanes with the KV cut to roughly 45K tokens (32768 leaves 302 MB of planned slack);
- freeing ~1.2 GiB elsewhere. Windows' own 1464 MiB is not enough by itself.

### What the CUDA graphs are worth (2026-09-25)

`ninfer-serve` at HEAD `432ec32` ran with the flags of `start-ninfer-server.bat`, changed to
one lane (`--max-concurrency 1 --device-state-slots 1`, rk4v4-e8, `--max-context 100000
--kv-capacity 100000`), once with and once without `--no-cuda-graph`. The request was the
profile prompt (`examples\cli\messages\scenario_code_python.json`) with thinking off
(`chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=false`), temperature 0, seed 1234 and 512 tokens.
Each configuration got the request three times; the table shows medians from the response
`timings`. A round is one verification: rounds = `predicted_n` - `draft_n_accepted`.

| Speculation | CUDA graphs | tok/s (three requests) | ms per round | Tokens per round | Acceptance | Graph reservation | Free after start (`nvidia-smi`) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DFlash2 d12, `--lm-head-draft` | on | 111.9 (111.3 / 112.0 / 111.9) | 32.4 | 3.63 | 22.2 % | 480 MiB | 1215 MiB |
| DFlash2 d12, `--lm-head-draft` | off | 109.9 (109.3 / 110.2 / 109.9) | 33.6 | 3.71 | 23.1 % | 0 | 1273 MiB |
| MTP 3, `--lm-head-draft` | on | 124.0 (124.2 / 124.0 / 124.0) | 25.9 | 3.22 | 74.8 % | 86 MiB | 3040 MiB |
| MTP 3, `--lm-head-draft` | off | 118.5 (118.6 / 118.5 / 118.4) | 27.1 | 3.22 | 74.8 % | 0 | 3043 MiB |

The graphs save 1.2 ms per round: -3.6 % for DFlash2 d12 and -4.4 % for MTP 3, whose
graphed and eager text is identical (+4.6 % tok/s). The d12 text differs between the two
paths (another near-tie), so its tok/s moves by the per-round saving and an acceptance
difference together.

The gain is under 10 %, so the two-lane capacity search with graphs was not run. With graphs
on, one lane reserves 480 MiB for DFlash2 (1152 MiB with three lanes, see above) and 86 MiB for MTP 3. For the three-lane
DFlash2 launcher, that makes `--no-cuda-graph` a cheap way to keep 100000 tokens of KV:
about 4 % of decode speed.

### Launcher choice: MTP 3 with CUDA graphs against DFlash2 d6 without graphs (2026-09-25)

Both configurations use the `start-ninfer-server.bat` flags: 3 lanes, 3 device state slots,
`--max-context 100000 --kv-capacity 100000`, rk4v4-e8 KV and `--prefill-chunk 1408`.
- **VRAM:** MTP 3 with graphs does not load the DFlash2 drafter (16.7 GiB of weights against
  18.3). Its three-lane graph allowance is 258 MiB. It starts with 2227 MiB free, where the
  current launcher leaves 435 MiB.
- **Method:** the two configurations ran alternated twice. Each got seven single requests:
  `scenario_code_python.json` plus the six prompts, thinking off, temperature 0, 512 tokens.
  The aggregate is total tokens / total decode time from the response `timings`.

| Round | DFlash2 d6, `--no-cuda-graph` (current .bat) | MTP 3, `--lm-head-draft`, graphs |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 86.9 tok/s (first two requests 49.0 and 66.2: post-start warm-up) | 108.6 tok/s, 25.26 ms per round, 2.74 tokens per round |
| 2 | 108.7 tok/s, 30.44 ms per round, 3.31 tokens per round | 108.9 tok/s, 25.19 ms, 2.74 |

Per request in round 2, d6 against MTP 3 (tok/s):

| Request | d6 | MTP 3 |
|---|---|---|
| code package | 112.6 | 126.8 |
| lighthouse | 81.5 | 87.3 |
| Python merge | 166.6 | 130.9 |
| transformer | 116.9 | 112.6 |
| Chile (es) | 79.8 | 89.6 |
| energy tips | 94.8 | 100.6 |
| train problem | 166.6 | 133.9 |

The steady-state aggregate is a tie: d6 wins the two most predictable prompts by ~25 %, and
MTP 3 wins the long code prompt and the prose by 5-12 %. Without graphs, d6's first requests
after a start are slower. MTP 3 does not win both rounds, so the launcher keeps DFlash2 d6. MTP 3
with graphs remains the option that frees ~1.8 GB of VRAM at equal steady speed.

### MTP 3 + n-gram chain against DFlash2 d6 (2026-09-25)

N-gram phase 1 (`--ngram chain`, pool 16 MiB, n = 8, V = 15; design and Bonsai results in
`docs/maintainer/bonsai-ternary-design.md` section 9.1, items 16-20). Measured with the CLI on the RTX
4090 at 60 Hz: one request, greedy, `--no-thinking`, `--kv-dtype rk4v4-e8`, `--lm-head-draft`,
up to 1024 new tokens, two rounds with the order reversed in round 2. DFlash2 d6 runs with
`--no-cuda-graph` as in the launcher, MTP with graphs. Four agent-style prompts restate their input
(add type hints to a Python module, bump ports in a JSON list, rename a phrase in a document,
rename a C++ variable); two are free-form (lighthouse story, transformer explanation).

| Decode tok/s (mean of both rounds) | DFlash2 d6 | MTP 3 | MTP 3 + n-gram |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent prompts (4) | 214.6 | 152.3 | 288.7 |
| Free-form prompts (2) | 95.6 | 97.0 | 97.1 |

Per prompt (round 1; round 2 within 2 tok/s): Python 207.0 / 150.5 / 273.3, JSON 219.1 / 152.3 /
271.5, document 221.3 / 152.9 / 374.5, C++ 208.9 / 153.9 / 234.6, story 75.7 / 83.6 / 83.7,
transformer 115.4 / 110.4 / 110.4. Tokens per round with n-gram reach 6.8-11.8 on the agent
prompts (MTP 3 alone: 3.9-4.0; d6: 6.5-7.0).

- On restating work MTP 3 + n-gram is 35 % faster than d6 and 90 % faster than MTP 3 alone.
- On free-form text the pool drafts nothing, so it equals MTP 3 (97.1 against 97.0) and is 1.6 %
  above d6.
- Scope: short contexts (under 2K tokens), one lane, no thinking. The launcher runs three lanes
  with thinking; the launcher is unchanged until that is measured through the server.

Through `ninfer-serve` at the launcher's flags (2026-09-25, measured; rk4v4-e8, 100000 context,
three lanes, `--preserve-thinking`, server sampling defaults, thinking on, `max_tokens` 4096, a fixed
seed per request, two server starts per variant with the order reversed). Sequential requests, one
lane active; decode tok/s from the request log:

| Decode tok/s (mean of both starts) | DFlash2 d6, no graphs | MTP 3 + n-gram, graphs |
|---|---|---|
| Agent prompts (4) | 169.1 | 165.4 |
| Free-form prompts (2) | 99.2 | 84.7 |
| Long-context edits (2; 10.6K and 6.6K-token files) | 138.6 | 258.3 |

- Long-context edits restate a function of the file, and n-gram doubles their speed (long1 151 ->
  288-300, long2 126 -> 217-229).
- On the short agent prompts most of the output is thinking, which the pool cannot draft, so the two
  tie.
- On free-form prompts d6 stays ahead (99 against 85). The sampled texts also differ between the
  variants: the transformer answer is 2537 tokens with d6 and 415 with MTP 3.
- Three concurrent requests: the wall-clock throughput ties (187 against 182 tok/s), but the sampled
  output lengths differ per variant, so this comparison cannot separate them.
- Prefill is unchanged by the speculative variant: 1.90-1.98K tok/s on the 6.6K and 10.6K prompts
  for both.
- Adopted on 2026-09-25 by the user: both Qwen3.8 launchers (`start-ninfer-server.bat` and
  `start-ninfer-server - mtp.bat`) now run `--spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft --ngram
  chain` with CUDA graphs (backups `.bak-20260925-ngram`). The 131072-context launcher starts with
  1.71 GB free after startup (graph allowance 580 MiB).

### Prompt attention producer offload: Qwen3.8 prefill (`7b6ed558`, 2026-09-26)

The int8/packed-KV prompt attention kernel now dequantizes V on the worker warps and hands P over
through one-sided named barriers (Bonsai design notes, section 9.1, item 22). Qwen3.8 uses the same
kernel, so its long prompts gain; the ternary GEMM changes of the same series do not apply to it.

CLI NIAH prefill, rk4v4-e8, `--prefill-chunk 1024`, `--max-context 132096`, MTP 3,
`--no-thinking`, measured on the RTX 4090 at 60 Hz. The build before the series and the integrated
build (`01f48d4f`) were alternated; 8K and 64K twice with the order reversed, 128K once. All answers
are exact.

| Prompt | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `long_niah_8k` | 3.9 / 3.9 s (1.96K tok/s) | 3.9 / 3.9 s |
| `long_niah_64k` | 37.4 / 37.3 s (1.73K tok/s) | 36.3 / 36.3 s (1.78K tok/s, -3 %) |
| `long_niah_128k` | 85.6 s (1.52K tok/s) | 82.4 s (1.58K tok/s, -4 %) |

MTP 3 decode on the six-prompt regression gives identical text at the same 25.9 ms per round. The
Qwen3.8 prefill remains GEMM-bound on the Q4/Q5 weights (about 1.9K tok/s at 8K against 4.4K for
Bonsai).

### Prompt attention V staging (`7843ddbe`, 2026-09-26)

The worker warps of the same kernel now stage and widen V with loop-invariant addresses (Bonsai
design notes, section 9.1, item 27); outputs are bit-identical. Kernel: rk4v4-e8 -4 % at 8K to
128K keys, int8 within noise. CLI NIAH prefill on the A8 artifact (`qwen3_8_27b_a8.ninfer`,
rk4v4-e8, `--prefill-chunk 1024`, `--max-context 132096`, MTP 3, `--no-thinking`, base and new
alternated, all answers exact): `long_niah_8k` 1.7 s both, `long_niah_64k` 18.5 / 18.5 -> 18.2 /
18.2 s (-1.6 %), `long_niah_128k` 46.6 -> 45.6 s (-2 %). Decode per step is unchanged (small-T
kernels are untouched). A FlashAttention-2 style rewrite with rows owned per warp and V widened in
registers was bit-identical but 12-20 % slower on this card (item 27).

## Swift 1.5 (Qwen3.8-27B fine-tune) against the base artifact (2026-09-26)

`ukisai/Swift-1.5-Qwen3.8-27b` is a merged LoRA fine-tune of Qwen3.8-27B trained to think less; the
architecture, config, tokenizer and MTP head layout are unchanged. Converted on Windows from the BF16
safetensors with the official recipe in 99 s (measured; same 20,437,521,664-byte size as
`qwen3_8_27b.ninfer`):

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m tools.convert --model E:\LLM\swift15-src --recipe qwen3_8_27b `
  --source dflash2=E:\LLM\dflash2-src --components text,vision,mtp,dflash2 `
  --resource chat_template.jinja=tools/chat_templates/qwen3_8.jinja --proposal `
  --name swift-1.5-qwen3.8-27b --out E:\LLM\swift15_27b.ninfer
```

CLI, greedy, thinking on (template default), int8 KV, MTP 3 with `--lm-head-draft`, one run per
model and prompt, order alternated per prompt; RTX 4090 at 60 Hz. Tokens are all generated tokens
(thinking + answer):

| Set | Base tokens | Swift tokens | Base decode | Swift decode | Correct (base / Swift) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Six short prompts (regression set) | 2,691 | 3,780 | 24.9 s | 34.2 s | n/a |
| Six hard problems (probability, a*b square count, zebra puzzle, LIS proof, cubic mod 7, clock) | 15,900 | 18,194 | 136.8 s | 143.7 s | 6/6 / 6/6 |

- Per hard problem, Swift / base tokens: 1116 / 1197, 11452 / 5850, 1706 / 2519, 1562 / 3952,
  1233 / 1282, 1125 / 1100. Swift thinks much less on three problems (-32 % and -60 % on two) and
  twice as long on the square-count problem, which dominates the total.
- On the short set, one explanation prompt is 2.3x longer with Swift (1901 against 814 tokens); the
  other five are within +-30 %.
- Decode speed per token and MTP acceptance are the same (the base MTP head serves the fine-tune).
- With one greedy sample per prompt, this does not reproduce the author's -24 to -46 % mean token
  reduction; the per-prompt variance is larger than the effect. The base artifact stays the
  default.

### Sampled comparison, Swift 1.5 against base (2026-09-26)

The greedy runs above do not match how Swift is evaluated, so the comparison was repeated with the
model card's sampling: temperature 1.0, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, min-p 0, thinking on (template
default `xhigh`), three seeds (11, 22, 33) per problem, model order alternated. Both models ran as
int8-prefill artifacts (`qwen3_8_27b_a8.ninfer` and `swift15_27b_a8.ninfer`, converted from the
Swift BF16 safetensors with `qwen3_8_27b_a8` in 155 s) on the same binary, int8 KV, MTP 3 with
`--lm-head-draft`, up to 20,000 new tokens. Script: `ninfer.exe <artifact> --prompt/--messages ...
--temperature 1.0 --top-p 0.95 --top-k 20 --seed <s>`.

| Problem (answer) | Base, mean tokens | Swift, mean tokens | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| AIME 2026 #1 (277) | 1,318 | 1,853 | +41 % |
| Probability, 4 of 12 balls (73/165) | 1,177 | 1,944 | +65 % |
| Pairs with a*b a square (310) | 11,600 | 5,760 | -50 % |
| Zebra puzzle (German) | 2,916 | 1,949 | -33 % |
| Cubic divisible by 7 (86) | 1,627 | 2,439 | +50 % |
| Clock right angle (3:32:44) | 2,047 | 1,207 | -41 % |
| **Total, 18 runs each** | **62,059** | **45,458** | **-27 %** |

- Both models answered all 18 runs correctly.
- Token-weighted decode speed: 121.8 tok/s base, 129.8 tok/s Swift; mean MTP acceptance 59.7 %
  against 64.5 % (16 of the 18 runs per model logged these fields).
- The saving comes from the long reasonings (the pairs problem: 12,463 / 9,497 / 12,841 against
  4,237 / 8,686 / 4,358 tokens); on problems the base solves in 1,200-1,600 tokens Swift often
  thinks longer.
- Two harder AIME 2026 problems (#15, #30), seed 11, up to 60,000 tokens: both models ran out of
  tokens on #15 (about 9-10 min each); on #30 the base ran out with the correct value (393) already
  in its reasoning, and Swift answered 372 after 42,021 tokens.
- Swift 1.5 therefore thinks about a quarter less on this set at equal accuracy, faster per token,
  less than UkisAI's reported -42 to -58 %. Published as
  [jgamboa/Swift-1.5-Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer-4090](https://huggingface.co/jgamboa/Swift-1.5-Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer-4090);
  the base artifact stays the default.

## Pipelined Q4/Q5 prefill GEMMs (`4ba151cf`, 2026-09-26)

The wide routes of the four Qwen3.8 prefill GEMM families (Q4 gate+up SwiGLU, Q5 `linear_add`
down/o_proj/out_proj, grouped Q4/Q5 GDN in_proj and attention qkvg; 96 % of prefill) now run one
engine, `src/ops/common/rowsplit_tall_mma.cuh`:

- 128 weight rows x 128 tokens (64 tokens for the 5120-row Q5 weights), 8 warps, one CTA per SM,
  64 KB of dynamic shared memory.
- Double-buffered dequantized-weight and activation stages with one barrier per K step; code
  bytes are loaded a step ahead.
- Ping-pong warp halves (warps 0-3 multiply then decode, warps 4-7 the reverse), as in the ternary
  GEMM of the Bonsai design notes, item 23.
- Token tiles launch fastest, so a row block's weights are shared in L2; the epilogue is staged in
  shared memory and written as coalesced 16-byte chunks.

The dequantization `bf16_rn(float(q) * float(scale))`, the m16n8k16 MMA sequence, the K order and
the epilogue rounding per output are unchanged, so outputs are bit-identical: a bitwise old/new
comparison at real shapes for T = 128 to 2048 found no differing output, and the quick perplexity
is 4.800742 before and after. The narrow routes keep their kernels.

Nsight Compute, T = 1024, SM clock locked at ~2.6 GHz:

| Kernel | Duration | DRAM read | Tensor pipe active |
|---|---|---|---|
| gate+up 34816 x 5120 | 3.31 -> 2.50 ms | 747 -> 111 MB | 32.3 -> 42.9 % |
| down 5120 x 17408 | 1.56 -> 1.26 ms | 245 -> 105 MB | 34.6 -> 42.9 % |
| o_proj 5120 x 6144 | 0.56 -> 0.46 ms | 46 -> 44 MB | 34.1 -> 42.4 % |
| GDN in_proj 16384 x 5120 | 1.36 -> 1.18 ms | 108 -> 67 MB | 38.4 -> 42.7 % |
| qkvg 14336 x 5120 | 1.17 -> 1.04 ms | 90 -> 54 MB | 38.9 -> 42.9 % |

ncu's tensor percentage is against the FP16-accumulate peak; 43 % is about 86 % of the
FP32-accumulate HMMA rate, so at most ~14 % remains in the gate+up kernel.

Op benches (cold L2, median us, T = 512 / 1024 / 2048): gate+up 1720 -> 1273 / 3184 -> 2400 /
6868 -> 5290; down 978 -> 742 / 1505 -> 1208 / 2758 -> 2398; o_proj 359 -> 273 / 549 -> 439 /
994 -> 860; GDN in_proj 794 -> 590 / 1526 -> 1167 / 2979 -> 2327; qkvg 644 -> 573 / 1166 -> 995 /
2272 -> 1990.

End to end on the integrated build (`build_qwen_base` = `29b203fc` against `4ba151cf`,
alternated twice; rk4v4-e8, `--prefill-chunk 1024`, MTP 3, `--no-thinking`; all answers exact):

| Measurement | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `long_niah_8k` | 3.9-4.1 s (1.89-1.96K tok/s) | 3.1 s (2.47-2.50K tok/s) |
| `long_niah_64k` | 36.0 / 36.0 s | 29.5 / 29.4 s (-18 %) |
| `long_niah_128k` (once, qwen-gemm agent) | 82.9 s | 69.2 s (-16.5 %) |
| `ninfer_bench` pp512 / pp2048, int8 KV | 1,813 / 1,998 tok/s | 2,457 / 2,584 tok/s |

Unchanged: the six-prompt greedy regression gives identical text for Bonsai (MTP 2) and Qwen3.8
(MTP 3) at the same ms per round, and the Bonsai `pp512`/`pp2048` rates are within noise. The
Q4/Q5 op tests (`ninfer_linear_swiglu_q4_a16_test`, `ninfer_linear_add_q5_a16_test`,
`ninfer_gdn_input_proj_test`, `ninfer_attn_input_proj_test`, `ninfer_linear_q4_a16_test`) pass
with unchanged criteria.

Rejected, measured: 128-token tiles on the 5120-row Q5 weights (down 1500 against 1261 us at
T = 1024: 40 row blocks leave a half-empty last wave) and decoding by the pong warps only (+25-30 %).

## Prefill against the official llama.cpp on this machine (2026-09-26)

Same RTX 4090 (display at 60 Hz), same Qwen3.8-27B fine-tune (Cold Fusion) in each engine's own
format, after `4ba151cf`:

- llama.cpp `a894dae` (official, MSVC + CUDA build) with `Qwen3.8-27B-ColdFusion-MTP-Q4_K_S.gguf`
  (16.32 GiB): `llama-server -c 132096 -ngl 99 --flash-attn on -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -ub 1024
  -b 4096 --jinja -np 1`; requests with `cache_prompt: false` and
  `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking: false`; prefill time from the response `timings`.
- NInfer with `coldfusion_27b_v2.ninfer` (Q4/Q5): `ninfer.exe --messages <prompt> --max-context
  132096 --no-thinking --prefill-chunk 1024 --kv-dtype int8 --max-new 16 --greedy`, no
  speculation; prefill time from `text prefill`.
- Prompts: `examples/cli/messages/long_niah_{8k,64k,128k}.json` (7,680 / 64,512 / 130,048
  prompt tokens in both engines). Two rounds, engine order reversed in the second. Every answer
  was exact.

| Prompt | llama.cpp r1 / r2 | NInfer r1 / r2 |
|---|---|---|
| 8K | 3.0 / 3.0 s (2,558 / 2,585 tok/s) | 3.1 / 3.0 s (2,470 / 2,530 tok/s) |
| 64K | 29.8 / 29.9 s | 29.4 / 28.9 s |
| 128K | 73.6 / 73.8 s | 66.8 / 66.9 s (-9 %) |

With 4-bit KV in both engines (llama.cpp `-ctk q4_0 -ctv q4_0`, NInfer `--kv-dtype rk4v4-e8`;
the E8-lattice keys keep more precision than `q4_0`), same protocol:

| Prompt | llama.cpp q4_0 r1 / r2 | NInfer rk4v4-e8 r1 / r2 |
|---|---|---|
| 8K | 3.0 / 3.0 s | 3.2 / 3.1 s |
| 64K | 29.8 / 29.9 s | 29.4 / 29.5 s |
| 128K | 73.0 / 73.5 s | 69.4 / 68.5 s (-6 %) |

Bench tools at depth 0 (`llama-bench -p 512,2048 -n 0 -fa 1 -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -ub 1024 -b 4096
-r 3` against `ninfer_bench -p 512,2048 -r 3 --kv-dtype int8`): pp512 2,756 against 2,334 tok/s,
pp2048 2,729 against 2,594 tok/s.

llama.cpp leads on short prompts (+18 % at 512 tokens, +5 % at 2K); the engines tie at 8K-64K and
NInfer leads at 128K, where attention weighs more. The weights differ slightly (Q4_K_S against
NInfer's Q4/Q5 mix), as do the KV formats (q8_0 against int8 with group-64 scales). The earlier
comparison in [docs/llamacpp-comparison.md](docs/llamacpp-comparison.md) was measured on another
4090 under Linux before the prefill work of 2026-09-25/26.

## A8 prefill GEMMs for Qwen3.8 (`83feb4c8`, `aa520f3f`, 2026-09-26)

The four Q4/Q5 prefill GEMM families (gate+up SwiGLU, `linear_add` down/o_proj/out_proj, GDN
in_proj, attention qkvg) have an int8 route for artifacts whose recipe grants `AllowA8` on their
inputs. From 129 columns on, the activation is quantized per token and 64-column group (aligned
with the weight groups: `scale = amax / 127`, `q = rint(x * 127 / amax)`, IEEE FP32) and the
stored Q4/Q5 codes are used exactly as int8 operands of m16n8k32 s8 MMAs; each group's int32 dot
starts at `0x4B400000` (one exact FADD) and `w_scale * a_scale` is applied in FP32 per group. The
kernel (`src/ops/common/rowsplit_tall_a8_mma.cuh`) keeps the pipelined, ping-pong structure of the
A16 tall kernel. Narrower widths (decode, MTP/DFlash2 verification) and `A16Only` artifacts keep
the exact A16 routes. The contract is in `docs/maintainer/op-development.md` section 6.4.

Artifact: `E:\LLM\qwen3_8_27b_a8.ninfer`, converted with the new `qwen3_8_27b_a8` recipe from the
existing artifact (no BF16 checkpoint), 212 s on the CPU:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m tools.convert --model <config dir> --recipe qwen3_8_27b_a8 `
  --source reference=E:\LLM\qwen3_8_27b.ninfer --source dflash2=E:\LLM\dflash2-src `
  --components text,vision,mtp,dflash2 --name qwen3.8-27b --device cpu `
  --out E:\LLM\qwen3_8_27b_a8.ninfer
```

The config dir holds the Qwen3.8 `config.json` (the one of `E:\LLM\bonsai2-27b-vl`; its text and
vision fields equal the artifact's) and the six resource files. All 1184 bound objects, the
components and the resources are byte-identical to `qwen3_8_27b.ninfer`; only the 512 Uses of the
granted projections became `AllowA8` (Q/K/gate/V/output of 16 attention layers, Q/K/V/Z/output of
48 GDN layers, gate/up/down of 64 MLPs: 80 + 240 + 192).

**Quality** (all measured):

| Check | A16 (`qwen3_8_27b`) | A8 (`qwen3_8_27b_a8`) |
|---|---|---|
| Quick perplexity, bf16 KV, overall | 4.800742 | 4.794439 (-0.13 %) |
| chinese_reference | 6.799864 | 6.777985 |
| english_long_form | 7.179659 | 7.181949 (+0.03 %) |
| english_reference | 6.442797 | 6.429567 |
| ninfer_code | 1.673776 | 1.673295 |
| NIAH 8K / 64K / 128K, rk4v4-e8 (ORCHID=493817) | exact | exact (all 6 runs) |
| tools/eval, thinking off, launcher flags (MTP 3 + n-gram) | 45/45 | 45/45 |

The `qwen3_8_27b` perplexity with the new binaries is 4.800742, identical to the baseline. The
six-prompt regression has prompts shorter than 129 tokens, so it runs A16 and its text is
identical (md5) for both artifacts. With six prompts of 188-452 tokens
(`examples/cli/messages/scenario_translation_{en_zh,zh_en,markdown}`,
`reasoning_jacobian_counterexample_3d`, `long_decode_aime26_{01,15}`; MTP 3, int8 KV, greedy, 512
new tokens) two outputs are identical and four diverge: at word 11 of 70 (a synonymous Chinese
phrasing), word 3 of 373 (a period after a heading), word 76 of 248 (one Chinese character) and
word 152 of 228 (`P_x` against `\partial P / \partial x`). MTP acceptance 76.4 % (A16) against
76.1 % (A8).

**Op benches** (cold L2, median us, A16 -> A8, two alternated rounds agree within 3 %):

| Family | T = 512 | T = 1024 | T = 2048 |
|---|---|---|---|
| gate+up 34816 x 5120 | 1332 -> 661 | 2507 -> 1227 | 4780 -> 2432 |
| down 5120 x 17408 | 742 -> 493 | 1207 -> 768 | 2392 -> 1296 |
| o_proj / out_proj 5120 x 6144 | 274 -> 189 | 438 -> 296 | 858 -> 492 |
| GDN in_proj 16384 x 5120 | 604 -> 281-290 | 1194 -> 532-556 | 2377 -> 1041-1089 |
| qkvg 14336 x 5120 | 574-600 -> 285 | 993-1041 -> 485-488 | 1979-2077 -> 953 |

The quantization kernel takes 18 us at T = 1024, K = 5120 (ncu, 89 % of DRAM peak). The 5120-row
Q5 weights pick 64- or 128-token tiles by one-per-SM wave cost (40 row blocks): 128-token tiles
alone were 8 % slower at T = 512 and 25 % faster at T = 2048.

**Nsight Compute, gate+up, T = 1024, 2.6 GHz:** 2.50 -> 1.26 ms; tensor pipe active 43.0 % (HMMA)
-> 43.0 % (IMMA); issue slots busy 14.5 -> 35.2 %; IPC 0.58 -> 1.41; DRAM read 137 -> 112 MB;
234 registers, 34.8 KB shared memory, one CTA per SM. Top stall reasons (warp samples): math-pipe
throttle, wait, selected, barrier.

**End to end** (CLI NIAH, rk4v4-e8, `--prefill-chunk 1024`, MTP 3, `--no-thinking`, alternated;
64K twice in each order, 128K once; `build_qwen_a16` for A16):

| Prompt | A16 | A8 |
|---|---|---|
| `long_niah_8k` | 2.9 / 2.9 s (2.67K tok/s) | 1.6 / 1.6 s (4.7K tok/s, -45 %) |
| `long_niah_64k` | 27.5 / 27.4 s | 17.1 / 17.1 s (-38 %) |
| `long_niah_128k` | 64.0 s | 43.3 s (-32 %) |

`ninfer_bench -p 512,2048 -n 128 -r 3 --kv-dtype int8` (alternated twice): pp512 2,539 / 2,543 ->
4,476 / 4,493 tok/s (+76 %), pp2048 2,789 / 2,760 -> 5,024 / 5,022 tok/s (+81 %); tg128 52.0 in
both. llama.cpp measured 2,756 / 2,729 tok/s on this machine. Decode is unchanged: the six-prompt
MTP 3 regression gives 23.7 ms per round and identical text for both artifacts and binaries, and
Bonsai (MTP 2) gives identical text on the old and new binaries.

Measured, not adopted: a lower A8 threshold. A8 is already faster from ~48 columns on (gate+up
406 us against 458-517 us at T = 48-128; GDN in_proj ties until ~80), but widths of 65-128 also
occur in batched speculative verification, which stays A16 by design.

Remaining headroom (estimated): the tensor pipe is still idle 57 % of the time; the next levers
are 128-K steps (half the barriers, needs a second int32 accumulator set), quantizing the SwiGLU
output inside the gate+up epilogue (saves the 17408-wide quantization pass and a BF16 round trip,
~7 % of the down projection), and fusing RMSNorm into the quantization.

Integrated verification on `feat/bonsai-ternary` (2026-09-26, same machine, A16 and A8 artifacts on
the same binary, alternated): the eight affected op suites pass (Q4/Q5 A16 and A8, GDN and
attention input projections, `linear_q4_a16`, `linear_t5`); quick perplexity 4.800742 (A16,
unchanged) and 4.794439 (A8); NIAH prefill 8K 2.9 / 2.9 s against 1.6 / 1.6 s, 64K 27.6 / 27.4 s
against 17.2 / 17.2 s, 128K 64.0 s against 43.0 s, every answer exact; `ninfer_bench` int8 KV
pp512 / pp2048 2,536 / 2,762 against 4,436 / 5,008 tok/s. The six-prompt greedy regression gives
identical text and ms per round for Bonsai (MTP 2) and Qwen3.8 (MTP 3) against the pre-A8 binary.

### A8 MLP activations quantized where they are produced (`316db048`, 2026-09-26)

`rmsnorm_swiglu_mlp` now also registers the Qwen3.8 dense MLP (Q4 gate/up, Q5 down, both
`AllowA8`), which the text layers use for every width. From 129 columns on, the RMSNorm row kernel
(the same 5120-wide CTA code as `rmsnorm`) quantizes its BF16 output to the gate/up A8 activation,
and the gate/up epilogue quantizes its BF16 SwiGLU output per token and 64-row group (one row block
is one group) to the down A8 activation; neither is stored in BF16 and the two separate
`a8_g64_quantize` passes of the MLP are gone. Narrower widths compose `rmsnorm`, `linear_swiglu`
and `linear_add` as before. The block is bitwise equal to that composition at every width
(`ninfer_rmsnorm_swiglu_mlp_q4_q5_test`, T = 1 to 300, which also checks the FP64 oracle); quick
perplexity is 4.794439 and greedy MTP 3 text is identical on five prompts of 65-492 tokens, at
23.0 ms per round on both binaries.

nsys, `long_niah_8k`, per 1024-token chunk (medians, base `b2f10487` -> new): the down-input
quantization (15.6 us) disappears, RMSNorm plus gate/up quantization (7.9 + 5.5 us) becomes one
10.6 us kernel, and the quantizing epilogue costs the gate+up GEMM ~10 us (1242 -> 1252 us), about
0.5 ms saved per chunk (~0.25 %). The Qwen3.8 quantization was already cheap because its inputs are
L2-resident right after they are produced. End to end, alternated, all answers exact: NIAH 8K
4.35/4.39 -> 4.45/4.45K tok/s, 64K 18.5/18.5 -> 18.4/18.3 s, 128K 46.7 -> 46.6 s; `ninfer_bench`
int8 KV pp512 4,564/4,539 -> 4,553/4,591 tok/s, pp2048 5,064/5,057 -> 5,086/5,102 tok/s (within
noise to +0.6 %).

Not done (estimated below 0.1 % each from the same trace): the RMSNorm fusion before the attention
qkvg (16 layers, ~5 us each) and before the GDN in_proj, whose BF16 input the gating projection
still reads. The GDN gated RMSNorm (20.7 us) plus out_proj quantization (6.2 us) could become one
kernel (~0.6 ms per chunk, estimated).

### A8 GEMM steps of 128 columns (2026-09-27)

The A8 kernel (`src/ops/common/rowsplit_tall_a8_mma.cuh`) now walks K two 64-value groups per
pipeline step instead of one, so a CTA barrier, the activation `cp.async` issue, the code-byte
loads and the loop bookkeeping serve 128 columns (64 MMAs per warp for a 128-token tile instead
of 32):

- Each thread decodes a whole group (32 code bytes, 8 high-bit bytes for Q5) of one row per
  step; code and activation lines are 128 bytes with 16-byte chunks XORed with `line & 7`.
- A warp keeps one int32 accumulator set: warps 0-3 multiply group 0, decode, apply group 0,
  then multiply and apply group 1; warps 4-7 apply the previous step's group 1 and decode, then
  multiply and apply group 0 and multiply group 1. The row and token scales take three buffers
  so warps 4-7 can still read the previous step's after the barrier.
- The activation staging keeps unsigned 32-bit source offsets (the launcher now requires
  `k % 128 == 0` and `tokens * k < 2^32`; every Qwen3.8 input qualifies). With 64-bit offsets
  ptxas spilled two values that were reloaded right after each barrier (15 % of the stall
  samples of the grouped kernel). No instantiation spills now (170-255 registers).

The per-output arithmetic is unchanged (same int32 group sums, FP32 FMAs in K order): a scratch
old/new harness over the grouped Q4+Q5 (16384 x 5120), residual Q5 (5120 x 6144 / 17408, 64- and
128-token tiles) and folded SwiGLU (BF16 and quantized outputs) problems at T = 129, 200, 300,
513, 1024 and 2048 gives byte-identical outputs (535 MB). The A8 op tests (`linear_swiglu_q4_a8`,
`linear_add_q5_a8`, `gdn_input_proj`, `attn_input_proj`, `rmsnorm_swiglu_mlp_q4_q5`) pass.
Quick perplexity (bf16 KV) is 4.794439 (Qwen3.8 A8) and 5.854904 (Bonsai) on both binaries, and
greedy MTP text (256 tokens; two short prompts, `scenario_translation_en_zh` 435 tokens,
`reasoning_jacobian_counterexample_3d` 492 tokens) is identical for both models at the same ms
per round (Qwen3.8 MTP 3 bf16 KV 25.5-26.1, Bonsai MTP 2 11.4-11.9).

Nsight Compute, T = 1024 (scratch harness, cold cache, ~2.57 GHz), base -> new:

| Problem | Duration | IMMA pipe active | Barrier stall per issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Folded gate+up, quantized output (34816 x 5120) | 1325 -> 1041 us | 40.8 -> 52.2 % | 0.95 -> 0.28 |
| Residual Q5, 128-token tiles (5120 x 6144) | 273 -> 240 us | 42.2 -> 47.9 % | 0.93 -> 0.40 |
| Grouped Q4 + Q5 (16384 x 5120) | 519 -> 508 us | 49.4 -> 50.5 % | 0.30 -> 0.47 |

The grouped problem (GDN in_proj, attention qkvg) was not barrier-bound and gains little; the
others were.

Op benches (cold L2, median us; base, new, new, base):

| Family | T = 512 | T = 1024 | T = 2048 |
|---|---|---|---|
| gate+up 34816 x 5120 | 689 / 656 -> 523 / 523 | 1282 / 1229 -> 977 / 978 | 2544 / 2439 -> 1940 / 1939 |
| down 5120 x 17408 | 495 / 495 -> 402 / 401 | 769 / 769 -> 715 / 687 | 1294 / 1295 -> 1202 / 1164 |
| o_proj / out_proj 5120 x 6144 | 189 / 187 -> 159 / 157 | 295 / 294 -> 267 / 266 | 490 / 489 -> 446 / 446 |
| GDN in_proj 16384 x 5120 | 278 / 289 -> 275 / 286 | 531 / 556 -> 520 / 541 | 1040 / 1092 -> 1022 / 1063 |
| qkvg 14336 x 5120 | 273 / 285 -> 265 / 275 | 465 / 487 -> 453 / 472 | 913 / 959 -> 887 / 925 |

End to end, Qwen3.8 A8 (base, new, new, base; 128K once each; all answers exact; the machine
was slower than on 2026-09-27 morning, so compare within the table):

| Measurement | Base | New |
|---|---|---|
| NIAH 8K prefill (rk4v4-e8, chunk 1024, MTP 3) | 1.7 / 1.7 s (4.45K tok/s) | 1.5 / 1.5 s (4.96K tok/s) |
| NIAH 64K prefill | 18.1 / 18.0 s | 16.7 / 16.7 s (-7.5 %) |
| NIAH 128K prefill | 45.3 s | 42.6 s (-6 %) |
| `ninfer_bench -p 512,2048 -r 3 --kv-dtype int8` pp512 | 4,204 / 4,205 tok/s | 4,786 / 4,769 tok/s (+13.6 %) |
| pp2048 | 4,680 / 4,686 tok/s | 5,203 / 5,191 tok/s (+11 %) |

Bonsai does not use this kernel for its projections: `ninfer_bench` pp512 / pp2048 5,223 / 5,214
-> 5,169 / 5,185 and 5,504 / 5,504 -> 5,515 / 5,517 tok/s (noise).

Measured, not adopted: compiling the pipeline separately for Q4 and Q5 row blocks (the grouped
kernel spilled 16 bytes again and was 2-19 % slower from T = 300 on); applying group 0 before the decode on warps
0-3 (more registers, 28-44 bytes of spills). The ternary t5 kernel already steps 128 columns
(one scale group); a 256-column step would need 128 KB of double-buffered stages (sm_89 allows
99 KB), and its barrier stalls are 6.8 % of the samples (ncu, gate+up T = 1024), so it was left
unchanged. All the A8 kernels now run the IMMA pipe at ~48-52 % of peak; the remaining stalls are
math-pipe throttle and fixed-latency waits with two warps per scheduler.

## Prefill work of 2026-09-26/27, integrated (`f3f4a037`)

The three changes of that round (Bonsai design notes, section 9.1, items 26-28: mixed-tile t5 GEMM
for the 5120-row weights, loop-invariant V staging in the int8 prompt attention, faster A8
quantization and the fused Qwen3.8 MLP quantization) were verified together on 2026-09-27 against
the `a2e5a449` binaries, with no other GPU work (item 29 has the full table):

- Outputs are unchanged: quick perplexity bitwise equal (Qwen3.8 A8 4.794439, Bonsai 5.854904) and
  identical greedy MTP text on four prompts per model.
- Qwen3.8 A8 NIAH prefill (rk4v4-e8, MTP 3): 8K 1.6 s both, 64K 16.8 -> 16.5 s, 128K 42.3 ->
  41.3 s; all answers exact. `ninfer_bench` int8 KV: pp512 4,622, pp2048 5,138 tok/s, tg128
  54.5 tok/s.
- Bonsai gains most: pp2048 6,027 tok/s, 64K 16.9-17.2 -> 14.6 s, 128K 42.8 -> 37.4 s.

## Decode round audit (2026-09-27)

Where a decode token or MTP round goes on the RTX 4090, measured with `nsys profile --trace=cuda,nvtx
--cuda-graph-trace=node` of `ninfer.exe <artifact> --messages
examples\cli\messages\scenario_story_en_mystery.json --max-context 8192 --max-new 512 --greedy
--no-thinking [--spec mtp --draft-tokens 3|2 --lm-head-draft]` at `12f87c61` (167 prompt tokens,
bf16 KV), per NVTX `decode` range. Bytes are the stored weights read per round (Q4_G64 34 and Q5_G64
42 bytes per 64 weights, Q8 34 per 32, t5 13 per 64 plus an FP16 scale per 128); GB/s against the
advertised 1008 GB/s.

| Per round, ms (measured) | Qwen3.8 A8, T = 1 | Qwen3.8 A8, MTP 3 (T = 4) | Bonsai, T = 1 | Bonsai, MTP 2 (T = 3) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Wall / kernels | 20.17 / 19.86 | 24.54 / 24.18 | 9.03 / 8.71 | 11.21 / 10.84 |

| MTP draft: proposal head (Q4, 131072 rows) + MTP layer | - | 1.19 + 1.58 (~2.4 GB, ~875 GB/s) | - | 0.81 + 0.66 (~1.26 GB, ~855 GB/s) |
| t5 A8 activation quantization | - | - | 0.74 | 0.76 |
| GDN (record/update, fold, gating, conv) | 0.39 | 0.96 | 0.47 | 0.90 |
| Attention (incl. rope, output gate) | 0.33 | 0.43 | 0.34 | 0.38 |
| Norms, sampling, glue | 0.22 | 0.32 | 0.10 | 0.18 |
| GPU idle (launch gaps; host and copy-engine gaps) | 0.31 | 0.36 (0.16; 0.21) | 0.32 | 0.37 (0.17; 0.20) |
| Whole round, weight bytes / wall | 778 GB/s (77 %) | 738 GB/s (73 %) | 620 GB/s (62 %) | 612 GB/s (61 %) |

The weight kernels already stream at 790-910 GB/s: the heads reach 880-910 GB/s, above the 845 GB/s
of the copy probe above, so that probe understates the read ceiling. Qwen3.8 at T = 4, per call:
gate+up (`q4_ksplit_mma`) 118.7 us (798 GB/s), the Q5 `simt_split2` down and o_proj/out_proj 50.2 us
average (788 GB/s, 46.8 us at T = 1), the Q4 sides of GDN in_proj and qkvg (`q4_rowsplit_gemm_simt`)
17.4 and 30.5 us (640 GB/s), their Q5 sides 820-848 GB/s. Nsight Compute on the T = 4 `split2`
(one CTA of two warps per row, 64 registers): 66.7 % theoretical and 47-53 % achieved occupancy,
DRAM throughput 84 % of peak for down (K = 17408) and 76 % for o_proj/out_proj (K = 6144). The
remaining MTP-round headroom on Qwen3.8 is small: ~0.4 ms in the T = 4 Q5 `split2`, ~0.3 ms in the
Q4 small sides, and the idle time.

The idle time was mostly the round's copies: in a CUDA Graph on this WDDM driver, each switch between
a kernel node and a copy-engine node idled the GPU for 15-35 us (ingress copy -> first kernel 25-35
us, D2D hidden copy -> egress copy 13-27 us, sampling -> egress copy 18-21 us), and the host waited
for the GDN replay fold before preparing the next round (fold -> next round 26-32 us).

`eabcb014` runs these copies as kernels (`kernel_copy_async`, pinned host memory read or written over
PCIe) and lets a continuing round submit its fold without waiting for it (rows that end or are
cancelled still wait). Bonsai's items (quantization at decode widths, GDN input loads) are in the
Bonsai design notes, section 9.1, item 30. Measured 2026-09-27, base (`12f87c61`) and new alternated
(base, new, new, base), six prompts, 512 tokens, greedy, MTP flags as above: text md5 (answer and
reasoning) and rounds identical for every prompt; quick perplexity (bf16 KV) 4.794439 and 5.854904.

| pp512 / pp2048 | 4,174-4,195 / 4,630-4,661 | 4,188-4,195 / 4,643-4,653 (unchanged) |
| NIAH prefill 8K / 64K / 128K (all exact) | 1.7 / 18.2 / 45.7 s | 1.7 / 18.2 / 45.9 s |

In the round trace the host and copy-engine gaps fall from 3.0 to 1.0 per round. What remains is the
host's turnaround between the round's egress and the fold launch (52-67 us), which needs the host's
committed count. The machine measured ~10 % below the 2026-09-27 main figures for both binaries on
this day (tg128 47.6 against 54.5), so compare within the table.

## Same-weights comparison with llama.cpp and the second integrated round (2026-09-27)

The 128-column A8 GEMM steps and the decode-round fixes were verified together against the
2026.09.27 release binaries (Bonsai design notes, section 9.1, item 31): bitwise-equal perplexity,
identical greedy text on 16 runs, Qwen3.8 A8 NIAH prefill 64K 18.1 -> 16.7 s and 128K 45.3 ->
42.5 s, Bonsai MTP 2 decode 187.3 -> 193.1 tok/s.

Both engines were then measured on the official Qwen3.8-27B weights quantized from the same BF16
checkpoint: llama.cpp `a894dae` with a Q4_K_M GGUF made here with `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` and
`llama-quantize` (15.65 GiB, MTP layer included), NInfer with `qwen3_8_27b_a8.ninfer`:

| Measurement | llama.cpp | NInfer |
|---|---:|---:|
| Prefill `pp512` / `pp2048` | 2,723 / 2,676 tok/s | 4,777 / 5,124 tok/s |
| Prefill 8K / 64K / 128K-token prompt (8-bit KV, answers exact) | 3.0 / 30.7 / 75.9 s | 1.5 / 16.5 / 41.8 s |
| Decode `tg128` | 43.1 tok/s | 47.8 tok/s |
| Decode, MTP 3, six prompts (greedy, thinking off) | 87.1 tok/s | 106.4 tok/s |
| Decode, MTP 3, 30K-token document | 66.8 tok/s | 87.2 tok/s |

Clean rerun (2026-09-27, card cool and idle at 26 C, P8, no other work), Qwen3.8 A8 on the
integrated build: `ninfer_bench -p 512,2048 -n 128 -r 3 --kv-dtype int8` pp512 5,339, pp2048 5,790,
tg128 54.7 tok/s; `long_niah_64k` (rk4v4-e8, MTP 3) 14.8 / 14.9 s against 16.0 / 16.2 s for the
2026.09.27 release binary, alternated, answers exact. The same-weights llama.cpp session above ran
about 10 % slower in absolute terms for both engines; its ratios stand.

## The 4090 without a display (2026-09-27)

The monitor now runs on the CPU's integrated graphics (UHD 770); the 4090 has no display and idles
at 0 MiB in P8. Build `78479e72`, two identical sessions, Bonsai design notes section 9.1 item 32:

| Measurement | Bonsai | Qwen3.8 A8 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Decode, MTP 2 / MTP 3, six prompts, greedy, thinking off | 217.9 tok/s | 120.2 tok/s |
| `tg128` | 128.5-128.9 tok/s | 54.6 tok/s |
| `pp512` / `pp2048` (int8 KV) | 5,800-5,893 / 6,108-6,113 tok/s | 5,307-5,312 / 5,730-5,765 tok/s |
| `long_niah_64k` (rk4v4-e8, answer exact) | 14.4 s | 14.9 s |

Prefill, `tg128` and the 64K prompt match the clean runs with the 4K60 dummy display attached
(Qwen3.8 5,790 / 54.7 / 14.8 s above), so an idle dummy desktop cost nothing measurable. The MTP
figures replace 193 / 105 tok/s from the slow session of the second integrated round, not a display
gain.
